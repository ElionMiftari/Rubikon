      <p>
        The Rubik’s Cube was invented in 1974 by Hungarian architect and professor Ernő Rubik as a teaching tool
        to explain 3D movement. It quickly became one of the most famous puzzles in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the cube fuels a global speedcubing community where solvers compete, innovate, and share methods.
        Rubikon celebrates this legacy with learning resources and premium cubes for every level.
